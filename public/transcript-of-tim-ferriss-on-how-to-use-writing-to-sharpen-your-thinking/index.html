<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk a little bit about how to<br>
use writing and why you should use<br>
writing to improve your thinking so I<br>
would credit much of the success I&rsquo;ve<br>
had to whatever extent I&rsquo;ve had success<br>
to learning how to write and to<br>
practicing writing and the reason for<br>
that is that without writing it&rsquo;s very<br>
hard to freeze your thinking on paper so<br>
that you can sharpen it so that you can<br>
see where for instance using words that<br>
aren&rsquo;t well-defined where you&rsquo;re saying<br>
things that don&rsquo;t need to be said all of<br>
this will help everything else I<br>
remember in college for instance when I<br>
took a class with John McPhee an<br>
incredibly gifted writer and teacher all<br>
of my grades and every other class went<br>
up because every extraneous bit of<br>
information that was hurting instead of<br>
helping me was taken out so to sharpen<br>
the salt a couple of different<br>
approaches</p>
<p>number one is write anything anything<br>
whatsoever stream-of-consciousness essay<br>
doesn&rsquo;t really matter let&rsquo;s just call it<br>
one two three pages something along the<br>
lines of morning pages and Julia camera<br>
and the artists way popularized this and<br>
there are a number of folks like Brian<br>
Koppelman very well-known writer<br>
screenwriter co-creator of the show<br>
billions swears by morning pages so that<br>
is an easy way to ease into the practice<br>
of just moving a pen I recommend<br>
freehand so that you can see your<br>
thinking on paper that accomplishes two<br>
things number one it takes the anxieties<br>
and nebulous worries in your head puts<br>
them down in a freeze frame so that you<br>
can kind of trap them in the printed<br>
form so you can get on with the rest of<br>
your day the second thing it does is it<br>
allows you to see where you are sharp<br>
and where you were dull in your thinking<br>
now if you are drafting as I do for<br>
instance right now once a week writing<br>
if you are looking for a proofreader and<br>
you do need a proofreader if you can&rsquo;t<br>
find a professional writer because we<br>
can&rsquo;t all find professional writers talk<br>
to friends who have any type of legal<br>
training or you could even hire a lawyer<br>
to do this or a paralegal someone with a<br>
law degree they are trained to look at<br>
language very very carefully because in<br>
a dispute in a negotiation and a<br>
disagreement arbitration it&rsquo;s going to<br>
come down to the<br>
wording of contracts and I have found<br>
that when I do not have access to<br>
professional writers it is oftentimes<br>
just as good or even better to get<br>
lawyers or people with legal training to<br>
read my writing so that would be a<br>
workaround that I accidentally<br>
discovered this is very powerful<br>
few things to keep in mind when you are<br>
then doing revisions because writing is<br>
in fact rewriting your gonna vomit out<br>
your first one or two pages and my<br>
mantra of sorts which I borrowed from<br>
someone else who is a career ghost<br>
writer is to crappy pages to crappy<br>
pages per day and very often you&rsquo;re<br>
going to exceed that and then write more<br>
but so that you set the game up in a way<br>
that is winnable to copy pages is your<br>
minimum and it can be just rain vomit it<br>
can be worthless but got to get two<br>
pages all right once you have those two<br>
pages you can approach revision in a few<br>
different ways and you can revise<br>
yourself say in three rounds like my<br>
friend Neil Strauss who I think has<br>
seven or eight New York Times<br>
bestselling books at this point when he<br>
does his first edit he edits for himself<br>
alright so he&rsquo;s editing just for his<br>
pleasure for his enjoyment for what he<br>
thinks is good then the second round of<br>
edits he will edit for his fans the<br>
people he thinks will really love this<br>
material the third round is for the<br>
critics the people who try to tear it<br>
apart to find little niggly points that<br>
they could twist and so on and that can<br>
be a helpful framework for revising what<br>
I do with proof readers and you can do<br>
this also with people who are not<br>
trained writers at all and in fact you<br>
should have some lay people so to speak<br>
people who are not writers as a craft<br>
very simply what I will ask people to do<br>
is read and highlight anything this<br>
could be in a Google Doc a word doc on<br>
paper that is confusing people can like<br>
what you write they can dislike it they<br>
can love it they can hate it but it<br>
should not confuse anybody that&rsquo;s the<br>
first thing I will do is I&rsquo;ll ask people<br>
just highlight anything that is<br>
confusing or unclear alright that&rsquo;s that<br>
step one anyone can do that<br>
the next is if you notice your mind<br>
wandering while you&rsquo;re reading this<br>
please note that alright so if something<br>
is slow<br>
maybe it can be taken out note where<br>
your mind starts wandering alright the<br>
dictum there is when in doubt take it<br>
out just be like I don&rsquo;t know if I<br>
should take I don&rsquo;t know if I should<br>
keep this or not take it out at least as<br>
an experiment the other question that I<br>
posed to proofreaders because you can<br>
train people to be very good<br>
proofreaders is the 10% rule and it&rsquo;s<br>
not really a rule but a guideline that I<br>
like to use so I&rsquo;ll say please indicate<br>
the 10% I should keep no matter what if<br>
there is 10% that I should keep no<br>
matter well what is the strongest 10%<br>
like there&rsquo;s 10% I have to keep please<br>
indicate that and if I had to cut 10% or<br>
even 20% in some cases all ask people<br>
please indicate what you would cut if<br>
you had to cut something even if this is<br>
an essay or a blog post that is a page<br>
or two long and what you&rsquo;ll find if you<br>
approach writing systematically in this<br>
way and revision systematically in this<br>
way is your cognition your analysis your<br>
awareness of how you use words how you<br>
use explanation how you use questions<br>
will become so much sharper that it will<br>
transcend this type of exercise and<br>
begin to positively affect just about<br>
everything in your life so for<br>
fulfillment for excitement for<br>
professional success for personal<br>
success</p>
<p><strong>I find writing to be arguably the most important practice.</strong><br>
good luck</p>
