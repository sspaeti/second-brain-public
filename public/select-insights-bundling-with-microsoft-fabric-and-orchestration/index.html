<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p><em>A quick note before we start: I changed the name of this newsletter to &ldquo;SELECT Insights&rdquo; and changed the structure slightly. I plan to follow this structure for the upcoming editions. If you want to know more, I have more details on 

<a href="https://newsletter.ssp.sh/" rel="noopener">newsletter.ssp.sh</a>. â€” And on another exciting side note, I also move the domain from 

<a href="https://sspaeti.com" rel="noopener">sspaeti.com</a> to 

<a href="https://ssp.sh" rel="noopener">ssp.sh</a>. I hope you like it; more on the history in this 

<a href="https://twitter.com/sspaeti/status/1661741201580769284" rel="noopener">Tweet</a>. But now, let&rsquo;s get into this month&rsquo;s newsletter.</em></p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s SELECT Topic is <a href="/brain/data-orchestrators" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/brain/data-orchestrators">Data Orchestrators</a>. Data Orchestration is a topic we must recognize, given the recent events and trends in the data ecosystem.</p>
<a href="#select-orchestration---dead-or-alive-4-min-read"><h2 id="select-orchestration---dead-or-alive-4-min-read"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>SELECT Orchestration - Dead or Alive? [4 min read]</h2></a>
<p><em>I kick things off with a thought-provoking topic, ranging from the intricacies of data engineering to the fascinating charm of everyday life experiences.</em></p>
<p>This is interesting from two standpoints. On one side, Dagster, through their parent company Elementl, 

<a href="https://dagster.io/blog/elementl-series-b" rel="noopener">raised $33 million in Series B funding</a>. And on the other hand, Microsoft announced its new product launch with a big bang, called <a href="/brain/microsoft-fabric" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/brain/microsoft-fabric">Microsoft Fabric</a>.  Why is this interesting, you might as? Because on the one hand, Microsft is bundling the whole Azure data stack into a single SaaS service, essentially bundling it into PowerBI.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dagster is bundling the 

<a href="https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/open-data-stack" rel="noopener">Open Data Stack</a> into a single <strong>control pane</strong>.</p>
<a href="#the-data-orchestration-challenge"><h3 id="the-data-orchestration-challenge"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>The Data Orchestration Challenge</h3></a>
<p>Data orchestration is increasingly vital as the hub of the 

<a href="https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-engineering-lifecycle/" rel="noopener">Data Engineering Lifecycle</a>. It combines the core aspects of data integration, transformation, and analytics in a cohesive, manageable workflow. The demand for more sophisticated orchestration tools is growing, as highlighted in the great 

<a href="https://www.finishslime.com/c/data-orchestrator-101" rel="noopener">summary of data orchestration articles</a> I recently read.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve observed a concerning trend - the unbundling of the orchestrator across various tools. Instead of allowing the orchestrator to do its job effectively, we are diverting away from this ideology, fragmenting the process across different devices and platforms. This is not the direction we should be heading.</p>
<p>Still, there is a lot of hype for now, but the good news. Microsoft, for instance, offers excellent no-code and <a href="/brain/closed-source-solutions-all-in-one" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/brain/closed-source-solutions-all-in-one">Closed-Source Solutions (All-In-One)</a> solutions to kickstart data engineering tasks. They are betting strongly on open standards with open-source 

<a href="https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-lake-table-format" rel="noopener">Data Lake Table Formats</a> Delta.io and Spark for computation.</p>
<p>What they still need to include, though, is an open-source orchestrator. They have some closed-source solutions, but they remind me more about the bad times of SSIS, with lots of missing efficiencies.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the Open Data Stack, which integrates the core needs of the data engineering lifecycle, could be our trustworthy, bundled solution.</p>
<a href="#is-the-orchestrator-dead-or-alive"><h3 id="is-the-orchestrator-dead-or-alive"><span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>Is the Orchestrator Dead or Alive?</h3></a>
<p>This brings me to the 

<a href="https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/symposium-invitation-is-the-orchestrator" rel="noopener">Symposium: Is the orchestrator dead or alive</a>? This engaging series, initiated by Stephen Bailey, invites authors from different fields to discuss the role of the orchestrator in today&rsquo;s data ecosystem. Some takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The need for speed and simplicity:</strong> The current data orchestrators should be more quick. They need to onboard use cases faster and justify displacing or running managed services through it.</li>
<li><strong>Data ingestion:</strong> This is a process that an orchestrator must own.</li>
<li><strong>Actions, not meta-narratives:</strong> GitHub Actions thrives by focusing on running things rather than what it should be.</li>
<li><strong>Integration:</strong> The most helpful orchestrator is one plugged into everything.</li>
<li><strong>Control vs. chaos:</strong> The orchestrator embraces chaos but of a certain kind: ordered chaos, not wasteful chaos.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I want to address the 

<a href="https://medium.pimpaudben.fr/data-engineer-is-a-transitional-job-ed0074c89646" rel="noopener">contention that Data Engineering is a transitional job</a>. Data engineering is not a job but a field. It&rsquo;s too broad to be confined to one role. Collaboration between BI engineers, DBAs, DevOps, data scientists, and more is necessary to leverage data effectively. After all, as we know, everyone needs data.</p>

Notes: SELECT Orchestration - Dead or Alive? [4 min read]  - To bundle or not to bundle

*I kick things off with a thought-provoking topic, ranging from the intricacies of data engineering to the fascinating charm of everyday life experiences.*

(another topic could also be microsoft announcement with fabric, and the way back to bundling - very connected with orechestration) -  in fact, the very thing that Microsoft don't have, is a good orchestrator. They have <a class="internal-link broken">No Code</a> solutions, that are great to get started, but worse when you go deep. It's just another way of SSIS again.

ON the other hand we have Dagster, who just [raised 33$ Mio series B funding](https://dagster.io/blog/elementl-series-b).
-  [Elementl Raises $33 Million in Series B Funding to Accelerate Data Orchestration and Unleash Advanced Data Use Cases | Dagster Blog](https://dagster.io/blog/elementl-series-b)
- Orchestration
	- awesome summary of all data orchestration articles: [Data Orchestrators 101: Everything You Need To Know To Get Started | The Finish Slime](https://www.finishslime.com/c/data-orchestrator-101)  

- I don't think so, that [Data Engineer is a Transitional Job](https://medium.pimpaudben.fr/data-engineer-is-a-transitional-job-ed0074c89646). It's more that data engineering is not a job, but a field. It's actually too big for one role. But as everyone needs data, BI engineer, DBAs, devops, data scientists and all people will collaborate on it.
	- Good pointers by [Dagster and the Decade of Data Engineering](https://dagster.io/blog/decade-of-data-engineering). And  how [MLOps is Mostly Data Engineering](https://www.cpard.xyz/posts/mlops_is_mostly_data_engineering/).

- the discussion of orchestrator symposium


The next topic I'd like to highlight from last week and month is the [data orchestrator](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-orchestrator/) and the [Symposium: Is the orchestrator dead or alive](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/symposium-invitation-is-the-orchestrator)? Stephen started with a series of authors from different fields. 

With the explosion of the data ecosystem, we started this newsletter because **orchestration will get more of a central piece** of the data stack. But unfortunately, we've started to unbundle the orchestrator in each tool, like "the catalog-as-orchestrator, the warehouse-as-orchestrator, the sql-formatter-as-orchestrator." Instead of having the orchestrator do its job to orchestrate our data and tools, we divert from that ideology. 

"Orchestrator to become one of the few services we trust." I'd go one more step and say the [Open Data Stack](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/open-data-stack/) will be the bundled solution we trust, containing the real need of the [Data Engineering Lifecycle](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-engineering-lifecycle/) with its core data integration, transformation, orchestration, and analytics.

Some inspiring highlights from some of the articles of the Symposium series:

* Simplicity and speed are where current data orchestrators fail. The orchestrator is losing today because it needs to be faster to onboard the use cases the engineers want, and it needs to be more complex to justify displacing or running managed services through it. It needs to do both.
* Data ingestion: one process an orchestrator _must_ own.
* GitHub Actions thrives because it eschews any meta-narrative around what it s_hould_ be used. It's just Actions. It runs things. GitHub Actions runs code; it's a primitive way of orchestrator.
* The orchestrator that's useful is the one plugged into everything.
* Existing tools are moving towards a less controlled model, but more is needed. Stephen says that Astronomer's push-button deployments, Dagster's declarative scheduling, Prefect's UI-driven flow registry, Datahub's stream-based metadata ingestion, Atlan's Zapier-like metadata actions.

Stephen asks the all-important question: "**Chaos or control?**" and says, "It boils down to activity or graphs." The orchestrator embraces chaos, but only of a certain kind: ordered chaos, not wasteful chaos. It reminds me strongly of the monolith vs. microservices discussion; I don't know why :).

Read many exciting pieces around Orchestration at Stephen Bailey's[ Symposium](https://stkbailey.substack.com/s/symposia) with two recent excellent reads (but all of them are): [28 Dags Later](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/28-dags-later) and [Data Materialization is a Convergence Problem](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/data-materialization-is-a-convergence). Also, check the latest orchestration comparison by Christophe Blefari, [Airflow alternatives Mage and Kestra](https://www.linkedin.com/events/airflowalternativesonlinemeetup7041351388609576960/comments/), and[ Prefect and Dagster](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7044560795581526017/comments/). These meetups provide an overview of the current state of data orchestration tools, giving you valuable insights into the pros and cons of each solution.
