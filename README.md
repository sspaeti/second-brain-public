# My Public Second Brain.

See on [brain.sspaeti.com](https://brain.sspaeti.com).

This is a fork of the [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) repo. I added some additional features such as:
* tagging with #publish will automatically copy the note from my private second brain in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to this public second brain. You find the python scrips in [utils](utils). 
* It also converts the first header (`# my title`) into the frontmatter (metadata of each note) and removes it so that Quartz needs it.

The content/notes itself are not published in this repo, only on [brain.sspaeti.com](https://brain.sspaeti.com).
