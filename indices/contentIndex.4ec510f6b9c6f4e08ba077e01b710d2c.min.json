Besides several boot camps, universities are also starting to get a degree in data engineering like [[Data Science]] did before. Let's start by defining what data engineering is.\n\n## What is Data Engineering\nData engineering is the less famous sibling of data science. Data science is growing like no tomorrow, as does data engineering, but much less heard. Compared to existing roles, it would be a **software engineering plus business intelligence engineer including big data abilities** as the [[Hadoop]] ecosystem, streaming, and computation at scale. \n\nBusiness creates more reporting artifacts, but with more data that needs to be collected, cleaned, and updated near real-time, complexity is expanding daily. With that said, more programmatic skills are required, similar to software engineering. **The emerging language at the moment is [[Python]]** (more [The Tool Language, Python](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/data-engineering-the-future-of-data-warehousing/#ThetoollanguagePython)) while used in engineering with tools identical to [[Apache Airflow]], [[Dagster]], other [[Data Orchestrators]], and data science with powerful libraries. Today as a BI engineer, you use [[SQL]] for almost everything except when using external data from an FTP server, for example. You would use bash and PowerShell in the nightly batch jobs. But this is no longer sufficient, and because it gets a full-time job to develop and maintain all these requirements and rules (called pipelines), data engineering is needed.\n\n## [[Data Engineering Best Practices]]\n- [Data Engineering Concepts](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-engineering-concepts#:~:text=conce/)\n- [Data Engineering Guides](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/data-engineering-guides/)\n\n---\n\nLinks:\n- [Data Engineering, the future of Data Warehousing? |](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/data-engineering-the-future-of-data-warehousing/)\n- [[data-engineering-explained-in-short]]\n\t- [Simon Spaeti's answer to What is data engineering?

To keep the overview and handle all these challenging tasks, you need an **Orchestrator** and some **cloud-computing frameworks** which I will explain in the two following chapters to complete the full architecture.\n\n\nOrchestrations are doing these things at heart:\n- invokes computation at the right time\n- models the dependencies between computations\n- tracks what computation ran\n\nMaking orchestrators experts on:\n- When stuff happens\n- when stuff is going wrong\n- what it takes to fix the wrong state\n\nTraditional Orchestartos focus on tasks. But newer generations e.g. [[Dagster]] focus on [[Data Assets]] and [[Software-Defined Assets]], which makes scheduling and orchestration much more powerful. For more see [[Dagster#Why it's so powerful]].

The best example is the first orchestrator out there, [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). Opposite to crontabs, modern tools need to integrate with the Modern Data Stack.\n\nTo understand the complete picture, let’s explore where we came from before Airflow and other bespoken orchestrators these days.\n\n1.  In 1987, it started with the **mother of all scheduling** tools, [(Vixie) cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)\n2.  to more **graphical drag-and-drop** ETL tools around 2000 such as [Oracle OWB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Warehouse_Builder), [SQL Server Integration Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services?view=sql-server-ver15), [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/) \n3.  to **simple orchestrators** around 2014 with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/)\n4.  to **modern orchestrators** around 2019 such as [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro), [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), or [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\n\nIf you are curious and want to see the complete list of tools and frameworks, I suggest you check out the [Awesome Pipeline List](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline#pipeline-frameworks--libraries) on GitHub.\n\n### Which tools\nAs of [[2022-09-21]]:\n- [[Apache Airflow|Airflow]] when you need \"dumb\" task scheduling only (no data awareness)\n- **[[Dagster]]** when you foresee higher-level data engineering problems. Dagster has more abstractions as they grew from first principles with a holistic view in mind from the [very beginning](https://dagster.io/blog/introducing-dagster). They focus heavily on data integrity, testing, idempotency, data assets, etc.\n* **[[Prefect]]** if you need a fast and dynamic modern orchestration with a straightforward way to scale out. They recently revamped the prefect core as [Prefect 2.0](https://www.prefect.io/blog/introducing-prefect-2-0/) with a new second-generation orchestration engine called [Orion](https://www.prefect.io/blog/announcing-prefect-orion/). It has several abstractions that make it a swiss army knife for general task management.\n\t* With the new engine Orion they build in Prefect 2.0, they're very similar to [[Temporal]] and supports fast low latency application orchestration\n\nAlso heard from Nick in the podcast [Re-Bundling The Data Stack With Data Orchestration And Software Defined Assets Using Dagster | Data Engineering Podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/dagster-software-defined-assets-data-orchestration-episode-309/).\n\n---\nReferences: [[Python]] [[What is an Orchestrator]] [[Why you need an Orchestrator]] [[Apache Airflow]]\nTags: #🗃/🌳 #🗺 #publish","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36450932Z","tags":null},"/deep-life":{"title":"Deep Life","content":"\nDeep life, and productivity on their own do not work.

It works best for me when having a dedicated tool and workflow.\n\nTo prove that, I tried all possible apps there is out there from [Wunderlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderlist), [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/), [Any.do](https://www.any.do/), [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), Simple List, [Google Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks\u0026hl=en\u0026gl=US) to [Microsoft Todo](https://todo.microsoft.com/). But none of them did the trick BECAUSE they missed the deeper methodology or framework. So what worked, you might ask? The book by [Getting Things Done by David Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-David-Allen-audiobook/dp/B01B6WSK5C/) had it all and clicked for me. To start with, you can follow these two simple steps:\n\n-   asking yourself: **What’s the next action?**\n-   **finish** every task you can do **within 2 minutes** immediately\n\n[![/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/GTD-getting-things-done-workflow.png](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/GTD-getting-things-done-workflow.png \"/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/GTD-getting-things-done-workflow.png\")](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/GTD-getting-things-done-workflow.png \"/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/GTD-getting-things-done-workflow.png\")\nOverview of the steps in the GTD Workflow | [Lifehack](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/gtd-workflow-chart.html)\n\nAnother big one was the **separation between adding a task to an Inbox versus reviewing each task** and asking the above next action question. This way, during capturing, I could focus on saving the tasks as quickly as possible, and in the reviewing face, I’d use a different part of my brain to make more profound thoughts on how to accomplish it or directly do it if lesser than 2 minutes. This differentiation many of us ignore, and we add tasks such as “do tax” and “change tires”. Instead, we could add actionable tasks such as “call accountant for a date”, “collect payslip”, or “call garage for appointment”.\n\nAs you can see, they are multiple times less stressful, and we can do it quickly, whereas the first one usually stays in our todo-apps for months and stresses us out every day.\n\nThere are other critical points such as **putting the next action into different _lists_ such as “Next, waiting, scheduled or someday/maybe”**. By adding tags such as #calls #atcomputer and others, you have a powerful way to filter all your tasks by the physical location where you can do them all in a row. There are more such filters, such as adding an energy level (low, medium, high) to pick tasks on a low energy phase or maybe a hard one in the morning after a good sleep. These are assigned to a project and categorised further into personal/work, which helps quickly find the relevant tasks.\n\nIn an app such as [[NirvanaHQ]], this looks something like this:  \n\n[![/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/nirvanahq-creating-todo.png](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/nirvanahq-creating-todo.png \"/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/nirvanahq-creating-todo.png\")](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/nirvanahq-creating-todo.png \"/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/nirvanahq-creating-todo.png\")\nProperties when creating a new Todo in Nirvana | Image by the Author\n\nThere’s much more to the GTD method. For example, the five steps, the first _capturing_ to the fifth _engaging_, and how to integrate the higher-level goals into the system. I suggest reading the [[Getting Things Done - David Allen]] as it can make a big difference in your life.\n\nI found that above mentioned NirvanaHQ implements the method the best way for me. There is no distraction as it hasn’t calendar integrations, no image upload, or no fancy emojis. I used [Todoist](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/todoist.com) last and tried to implement the GTD method until I switched for the same reasons mentioned in [My thoughts on changing to Nirvana](https://noisydeadlines.net/gtd-journey-my-thoughts-on-switching-to-nirvana).\n\nThe more human and overall goal is to put everything into an external system as your brain doesn’t do well storing/remembering things. By writing everything down, you will feel relieved. **The challenge is to keep your system up-to-date so that the brain trusts it**. That you won’t think: “Oh, I need to remember this because the system is not trustworthy”.\n\n\u003e [!info] Trigger Events\n\u003e The Calendar itself can hold to-dos. Instead of cluttering your todo app with tasks a long time in the future. Put them in the calendar when it’s important and add them when they trigger at a specific time. The key is to have a trusted calendar same as the todo app.\n\n\u003e [!note] Six Horizons of Focus\n\u003e Another one is to integrate [[The 6 Horizons of Focus]] into your projects and to-dos. Which makes sure your 2-3 and 5-year long-term goals are respected, and you always have them in the back of your mind and to-dos.j\n\n---\nOrigin: \nReferences: \nTags: #🗃/🌳 #publish  \nCreated [[2022-04-06]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/how-to-build-a-second-brain":{"title":"The Building a Second Brain methodology will teach you how to:","content":"\n1. **Consistently move your projects and goals to completion** by organizing ahd accessing your knowledge in a results-oriented way\n2. **Transform your personal knowledge into income**, taking advantage of a rapidly growing knowledge economy\n3. **Uncover** **unexpected patterns and connections** between ideas\n4. **Reduce stress and “information overload”** by expertly curating and managing your personal information stream\n5. **Develop valuable expertise, specialized knowledge, and the skills** to deploy it in a new job, career, or business\n6. **Cultivate a collection of valuable knowledge** and insights over time without having to follow rigid, time-consuming rules\n7. **Unlock the full value of the wealth of learning resources all around you**, such as online courses, webinars, books, articles, forums, and podcasts\n\nMost important take aways:\n\n* ## B) Organize your content by project\n  * Instead of organizing your files primarily by topic (for example, web design or psychology), which is time-consuming and mentally taxing, organize them according to _the projects you are actively working on_.

It grounds me similarly to meditating. I always heard on the [[Tim Ferriss]] [Podcast](https://tim.blog/) that “successful” people meditate and journal a lot. I never understood the term journaling until I started it myself.\n\nWhat helped me get started was the instructions by Derek with the idea of _[Thought On](https://sive.rs/dj)_ files. By doing all journaling digitally in a [plain text](https://sive.rs/plaintext) file and creating a separate one. Therefore I can read at a glance what I journaled, pondered, and thought off last time, can reflect on it, and go deeper. Sometimes the previous journal entry is from years back, and of course, I do not remember, but giving me tons of insights as these are my thoughts. It’s a little like time travel back and talking to myself back then.\n\nBesides the thought of journaling, I also do [dailies](https://thomasgriffin.com/how-to-journal-daily/#:~:text=Daily%20journaling%20is%20the%20act,daily%20journaling%20being%20surprisingly%20simple.) whenever I have time. In these, I usually dump whatever is stuck in my head right now and offload it to my journal and then ask questions about it. Why do I feel like this, or what can I change to feel better, and so on.\n\nEvery two or three months, I reflect on all levels where I have a bunch of questions (I use the [[🔃  Reflection Template]] by [[Zowie from Systematic Mastery]]) about all kinds of things which takes me about 30 minutes and more.\n\nAnother way is to start with [11 curated questions](https://www.curatedquestions.com/tim-ferriss-tribe-of-mentors#:~:text=It%20could%20be%20a%20few,time%2C%20energy%2C%20etc) Tim Ferriss asked everyone in the book [[Tribe of Mentor (Tim Ferriss)]] and see what you come up with.\n\n## Digital vs Paper\nWriting is therapy! I usually write as much as possible on my laptop because I can type as fast as I think. At the same time, my handwriting can’t keep up with my thinking speed. There is no slowing down and forgetting ideas or thoughts. On the other hand, I can reformat, re-arrange, add, and delete, which will help my thinking process which wouldn’t happen in my brain. The advantage of pen and paper is that I use different muscles and brain activities when I write, which helps me think differently. I usually use them when I need to outline my blog post, if I’m stuck or distracted on something, or if I go out in nature and only bring my physical journal.\n\nAlso, when writing journals or other ideas within my second brain, I can start connecting them. Improving my thoughts over time and generally refind easily and read them, whereas, on paper, notebooks get lost over time, and finding the right things when needed is very hard.\n\n---\nOrigin: \nReferences: \nTags: #🗃/🌻 #publish \nCreated [[2022-08-27]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/kubernetes":{"title":"Kubernetes - DevOps Engine","content":"\nIt’s a platform that allows you to run and orchestrate container workloads.

Also, check out [[Stackable Kubernetes Cluster (Lego Blocks)]] which were created to mitigate exactly that.\n\nSome more reasons for Kubernetes are the **move from infrastructure as code** towards **infrastructure as data**, specifically as [[YAML]]. All the resources in Kubernetes that include Pods, Configurations, Deployments, Volumes, etc., can simply be expressed in a YAML file. Developers quickly write applications that run across multiple operating environments. Costs can be reduced by scaling down (even to zero with, e.g. [Knative][63]) and also by using plain python or other programming languages instead of paying for a service on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. Its management makes it easy through its modularity and abstraction, also with the use of Containers ([[Docker]] or [Rocket][65]), you can monitor all your applications in one place.\n\nTo get hands-on with Kubernetes you can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) with Kubernetes included. All of [my examples](http://code.sspaeti.com) are built on top of it and run on any cloud as well as locally. For a more sophisticated set-up in terms of Apache Spark, I suggest reading the blog post from [Data Mechanics](https://www.datamechanics.co/) about [Setting up, Managing \u0026 Monitoring Spark on Kubernetes](https://www.datamechanics.co/blog-post/setting-up-managing-monitoring-spark-on-kubernetes).

After a while, I procrastinated and was distracted way more whenever I wasn’t in vim. **Being in a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) with no buttons and no fancy UI, my brain focused on the essentials**. It was mental clarity at its best, almost like meditation. What vim did as an editor, did  [[Markdown]] as a format. It is plain text with added formatting. That way, own my notes fully and free of any proprietary format, which is liberating.\n\nVim, together with lots I’ve read from [[Derek Sivers]] and many others from the [Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/), were a big inspiration for me. Derek with his fantastic [[⚛️ Areas/✍🏻 Writing/Writing]] and [podcasts](https://sive.rs/podcast) taught me how to write, make it fun to find better wording and strip all sentences to a bare minimum. He practised [[minimalism]] to its best in all kinds of ways of living. He [removes all unused HTML tags](https://sive.rs/2020-03-mw) or `\u003cdiv\u003e`-blocks from his websites in the same way he does in his digital life in his journaling or writing. This is important **as minimalism with less stuff gives you clarity and more freedom. All of this and many more set the foundation for my PKM workflow.**\n\nWhat came later was a flow of methodologies I learned from books and podcasts, which I integrated into my workflow so that my brain could focus on the creative part of the equation, the thinking.\n## [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]]\n\n## [[Deep Life]]\n\n## Other Factors\nAfter all I’ve said already, I want to state that it’s clear that nothing will work without the fundamentals such as sleep, healthy food, hydration and general habits with sports and family.\n\nReading lots of the above probably overwhelms you more than anything else. Please understand that these systems and learnings have been assembled over the last 10+ years. They helped me in my daily work or gave me more mental clarity. The same I’m trying to provide for you here.\n\nBelow we go through other factors that I find necessary to round up the whole PKM system with the deeper life.\n### Family, Music and Environment\nSame as the physical elements, family and emotions are a big thing is seen in the [[What Makes a Happy Life]] chapter.\n\nSame as changing the tooling such as [[vim]] to a distraction-free editor. It’s also for the environment. **If you switch to a coffee place or co-working space you have never been to, your brain will be inspired by the surroundings and get creative**. If you work in a dull place or feel reminded of something terrible, you will also perform as such.\n\nSame as the environment is also the music. **Listening to [distract free music](https://sspaeti.com/blog/tools-i-use-part-iii/#music-focused) or your favourite song on repeat will boost your productivity** by a lot compared to emotional music that sole purpose is to touch you emotionally, which is a terrible thing when you try to get things done.\n\n### [[Money]] and [[Emotions]]\nMost of us live in a first world country where money is everywhere. We want all to have more. We admire rich people and want to be like them, but do not work as hard. We can’t pay taxes or health insurance because we worry about not having enough. Even if we don’t admit it, worries about money are always there, especially as parents who want to provide for our families.\n\nWe need to know about [[The Psychology of Money - Morgan Housel]] to have an excellent mental workflow, which says that everyone should save for a future unknown. It’s okay to save for a house or a car. But it should be even more okay to save just for saving. **Having spare money on the side is the best thing you can do for a deeper life**. It gives you possible freedom and a calm state. If you know at any time that you can leave a job can go to a deserted island for a while to reload your batteries, this will give you more mental clarity than any other. And **how do you achieve that? Exactly, by saving for tomorrow**. To have that extra cash when you need it, on that unfortunate occasion, something terrible happens.\n\nAnother one is **compounding**. [[Waren Buffet]] is only overly decadent than anyone else because he started to save at age 5. Derek Sivers got [rich](https://sive.rs/richand) when he was 22, reducing his spending to 1000$ while earning 1800$ a month for two years. That gave him 12k to leave his job and be a full-time musician.\n\nBesides the financial value of money, it’s a lot about **emotions**. For example, nobody can judge another person’s decision to buy an expensive car or invest in the lottery. Everyone has a different perception. For the poor who spends on average 400$ for the lottery and at the same time average poor person misses exactly that money to buy food, it seems like a dumb decision. But if you try to understand that that person may be all year fights for getting enough food, buying a lottery ticket is the only moment he can dream of getting out of that hard work and providing a good life for his family. Although we can’t feel the person’s emotion, we can much better understand why poor people might buy lottery tickets they can’t afford.\n\nThink of it this way: we give up 40 hours a week to have cash. Time is the currency of life, and wasting time is wasting money. Invest your time wisely.\n## Conclusion\nWhile writing all this, I listened to the book [[Four Thousand Weeks, Time Management for Mortals - Oliver Burkeman]], and I have to say it’s the best conclusion and much more in terms of time management and productivity hype, in a very grounding way.\n\nHe also gets lots of time philosophical, which I believe is a good thing. Today we need to be more mindful of it: **Living more in the present, aware of minorities, other cultures, and other opinions**.\n\nThis article began with a simple PKM system in mind but ended with all facets of life. The more I wanted to keep it solely about PKM, the more it became clear that the very existence and involving my second brain is about life. What I like, how I do things, and what is meaningful to me.\n\nSo no matter what you think about the second brain and sophisticated PKM workflow (or what they will become in the [future](https://youtu.be/nhAVXkm-kww)). In the end, it’s also about our life, what we want to learn, and how we want to be in this world.\n\nIf you read it that far, I have to congratulate you. People rarely read such long articles in today’s attention-driven and high dopamine searching economy. I thank you and wish you the same joy and excitement in building and optimizing your PKM system and, therefore, your second brain for a deeper life.\n\n---\nOrigin: [Personal Knowledge Management Workflow for a Deeper Life — as a Computer Scientist |](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/)\nReferences:  [[Record Blog Post as Audio]]\nTags: #🗃/🌻 #publish \nCreated [[2022-08-27]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/plural":{"title":"Plural.sh","content":"\nPlural.sh is a unified application [[deployment]] platform that makes it easy to run [[open-source]] software on [[Kubernetes]].

If you are not a bookworm or not reading generally, you won’t agree with this. But as someone who didn’t read at all or was slow for a long time, I can tell you it’s true. Because by reading, you enlarge your horizon, you learn something new, or if you read a fantasy book, you dive into another world in an undistracted calming way.\n\nI rarely read fantasy, though. I get quickly bored as I’m not learning anything new. That is fine for me on vacation, but other times, I do not want to “waste” my precious time on it. For sure, that is different for everyone.\n\nA game change was opening an account on [Audible](https://audible.com/). I’m listening now to a book a month compared to before, maybe once a year. Additionally, I listen to many podcasts and try to produce besides only consuming. But reading, or in my case, listening to books, is a pleasure. If you are not reading or listening to books, I’d say you didn’t find the right book yet. Because there are [129'864'880 Books](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/google-there-are-exactly-129-864-880-books-in-the-world/61024/) in the world, and if you find a good one, you do not want to stop reading it.\n\nWhat keeps me listening to more audiobooks is that these are downloaded offline to my phone. So when I’m on a plane or anywhere else, I can listen. It’s also handy to read ten minutes if I am standing in a line, waiting for a friend, doing the dishes or a couple of minutes before bedtime with the phone in flight mode. Listening to my favourite book instead of _only_ waiting in line always gave me a sense of happiness.\n\nBy reading, you learn more. By learning, you are a happier person, I believe. Therefore [Live as you die tomorrow, learn as you live forever](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mahatma_gandhi_133995).\n\n\u003e [!hint] Finishing Books\n\u003e Don’t feel bad to not finish books. Sometimes authors write 300 pages about something which could be said in two sentences. So don’t feel shy if you got the gist after reading only part of the book and it does not get better. What I do is skip several chapters and see if it gets better. If not, I delete it from my audible and take the next one.\n\n\u003e [!note] Want to Read List\n\u003e As well keep a want to read list somewhere (I use [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/)). You always have interesting books in the pipeline that people suggested or heard on a podcast. Also, the ratings on Goodreads or Amazon are good indications if a book is worth a while or not. Also, please read the comments. Sometimes, some bad critics are something you like or enjoy.\n\n---\nOrigin: [[Personal Knowledge Management Workflow for a Deeper Life]]\nReferences: [[My Favorite Quotes (Zitate)]]\nTags: #🗃/🌳 #publish \nCreated [[2022-08-27]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/restack":{"title":"Restack.io","content":"\nThe simplest way to manage stacks of open source products on a production-ready [[Kubernetes]] cluster.

The best format I found was the [[Second Brain]]. Before I read all about it, I had already taken notes for [10+ years](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/how-to-take-notes-in-2021/) and saved them in Microsoft OneNote in several notebooks. Hearing [[Tiago Forte]]'s [Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/40O0Lbp5ockSt0qSogo6q1) (short and concise) blew my mind. I took notes almost all my life but never thought of it as my second brain. On top of it, sometimes valuable information I didn't capture just because I didn't have that mental model of a second brain and nowhere to save, so I just skipped it. \n\nFor example, when I visit my doctor or the dentist today, I will write the condition of my health or my teeth in my second brain. I had COVID recently, and I found it necessary enough for my future self. Therefore added my symptoms and the details so that next time I have a check-up or want to assess my health, I can open my notes from my second brain and connect the dots. \n\nSo what is the second brain? In short, it is a **methodology for saving and systematically reminding** us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we've gained through our experience. It expands our memory and intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks. It is for **preserving those ideas but turning them into reality**. It provides a clear, actionable path to creating a \"second brain\" – an external, centralised, digital repository for the things you learn and the resources from which they come. If you want to know all about it, read Tiagos's [complete article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) on it.\n\nAfter reading that, I transformed my folder-organised notes into an entire second brain. I started changing the **structure from my nested librarian folder to [[Folder Structure P.A.R.A.]]**. **PARA stands for Project, Area, Resources, and Archive**. And that are the only four folders you have in this system. Regarding Tiago, our brain is not built to handle an infinite amount of nested folders. That's why PARA tries to keep **no more than four levels**.\n\nTo give you an idea of what the structure of my second brain can look like, below you find folders I created inside the PARA structure:\n\n\u003e [!example] Obsidian Folder Structure with PARA \n\u003e \n\u003e ![[Pasted image 20220819220022.png]]\n\nIf you want to build the same structure yourself, follow the step-by-step explanation by [Systematic Mastery from Zowie](https://youtu.be/uqVx22lo9_4)). There is no right or wrong, it's your second brain, and you need to find out what works best for your brain.\n\n\u003e [!important] Choosing the Right Tool\n\u003e It's important to find the right tool for what you are doing. I like the [differentiation](https://youtu.be/f3dDVtJ2sec) between 1. Librarian (mostly stage one when collecting info), 2. Architect (stage two with organizing knowledge), and 3. Gardener (stage three with digesting knowledge and making [connections](https://youtu.be/QgbLb6QCK88)) and choosing the tool accordingly. \n\nSome benefits you'll get from the Second Brain:\n- it **transforms your knowledge into your physical second brain** by acknowledging and being able to bring it everywhere you go\n- it **uncovers unexpected patterns and connections** between ideas while writing down and tinkering with your thoughts\n- it **reduces stress and \"information overload\"** by trusting in your system and growing your knowledge and connections\n- it **develops valuable expertise, specialised knowledge, and the skills** around your notes and thoughts which help your personal life, new job, career, or business\n- and it **cultivates and captivates valuable knowledge** and insights over time without having to follow rigid, time-consuming rules\n\n\u003e [!info] Only keep what resonates with you\n\u003e\n\u003e Important again to only keep in your second brain what resonates with you. Don't copy-paste from the internet. Add a link to the original article and write what it's all about in your own words.\n\n**Generally, when taking notes, remember to make them for your future self**. It does not hurt you to add a lot of copied text now, but within a couple of years, it will clutter your second brain and take away most of the [joy](https://youtu.be/q0Pf6ZePNGc). Instead, envision that all notes you linked are thoughts of yours. You'll be instantly reminded of what a particular thing was and can easily connect these thoughts to other ideas when you read. It starts to form a second brain with connections from one note to one or several others. And our (first) brain works the same, and because of it, it feels so natural to store it in such a way.\n\nIn the following chapter, we're going to cover the [[Zettelkasten]] method, which in some cases is used interchangeably with a second brain. They are not, and I will explain what it is and how I integrated it as a dedicated folder in mine.\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e By the way: Your [contacts](https://contacts.google.com/) in google, your [password tool](https://www.lastpass.com/), [email](https://www.hey.com/), all of it are also second brains. So you do not need to have only one.\n\nMore on [[How to build a Second Brain]].\n\n---\nOrigin: [[Personal Knowledge Management Workflow for a Deeper Life]] \nReferences: \nTags: #🗃/🌻 #notetaking #publish \nCreated [[2022-03-26]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/smart-note-taking":{"title":"Smart Note Taking","content":"\nWhy is this important? Because without the _smart_, you’ll add more clutter to your system, leading to minor organization and more stress.\n\nFor your mind to relax, you need to let go of things in your head. Best to release them in an external system. I usually let off my thoughts by dumping them all into a blank file in my text editor of choice. Doing this is more the [[Journaling]] approach to the note-taking journey. The other is general note-taking.\n\nOne principle I strongly agree with from the book [[Smart Note Taking (Sönke Ahrens)]] by [[Sönke Ahrens]] is that **writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thought occurs**.\n\nWhen you write about an idea or a blog post, the goal is not to start from a blank paper or a file, which leads to more procrastination. So what’s the alternative? With **Smart Note Taking, you write smaller notes and start connecting them in your Secon Brain**. Instead of brainstorming, you connect thoughts and naturally generate new ideas.\n\nIn life, no projects arrive in sequence. **It’s easier to work on multiple projects and ideas simultaneously because you write the current state of thought**. Next time you can continue at the exact spot you left. No dread to forget the latest. You have personal responsibilities you need to take care of, work, family related. All of which have their project and thoughts.\n\n**Another important aspect is that your brain will not rest until a task is finished**. As we can’t complete all tasks on the spot, it helps that it does not distinguish between _finished_ or _written down_. Therefore writing things down lets your mind and yourself rest, which is what [[Getting Things Done (GTD)]] focuses on.\n\nWhen taking notes, it’s essential to **stay open and even seek opposing opinions and challenge what you already know**. Through that curiosity, you will get better at writing and, therefore, thinking.\n\nRecall seven random numbers is hard. It’s much easier if **numbers are connected by years, such as all football world cup events. That’s why we connect the notes when we take smart notes** and bring them to the next level with the [[Zettelkasten]] Method.\n\n[[Nick Milo]] calls it **note-_making_ instead of taking** to emphasize the thinking part of just capturing notes.\n\nThere is so much more to smart note-taking. I suggest, either read the [book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502) by Sönke or if in a hurry, the summary by [[Tiago Forte]] [here](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/).\n\n\u003e [!hint] Writing is Thinking\n\u003e  Remember: Writing is _thinking_. Without writing, there is no thinking, no progress. The more you write, the more notes you take, and the better of a thinker you become. You’ll read better with better questions in your mind.\n\n---\nOrigin: \nReferences: \nTags: #🗃/🌳 #publish   \nCreated [[2022-08-27]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-28T07:58:14.36850926Z","tags":null},"/stackable":{"title":"Stackable","content":"\nThe modular open source data platform: Popular data apps.

Famous leaders have been practising and shaping it, such as [[Marcus Aurelius]], the emperor of Rome, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Epictetus]], [[Seneca]], to name a few.\n\nI got hooked when I read my all-time favourite book [[The Daily Stoic - Ryan Holidays]], which makes it easier for people new to it. Quotes such as focusing on what’s in your control are stayed strong until today:\n\n\u003e The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I control… — Epictetus\n\nI practise this every day. For example, with [[COVID19]], [we can’t control it](https://dailystoic.com/remember-you-dont-control-what-happens-you-control-how-you-respond/), no cursing, no ignoring will ever make it away. So the only way is to control ourselves and decide how we want to react to it. It’s another classic one, but many people face it twice a day and **valuable waste energy in traffic when they get angry at other drivers**. Why? Does it make any of it go away? Not really.\n\nInstead, I try to think for myself that these people we get angry at just having an emergency, maybe they are on the way to the hospital. If thinking it in that way, at least to me, I’m not even mad at them anymore. The same goes for the weather. How many people are in a bad mood if the weather is not as the weather forecast proclaimed, or if it’s just bad? Next time, try not to think you can control the outcome; instead, maintain your reaction towards it by not getting angry or just staying calm.\n\nThis book is so powerful that I always have it on my phone, and at least once a week, I listen to two or three chapters. As the title says [366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736), is applied meditation to me.

Not reading the news doesn’t mean that I’m uninformed. But I stopped reading the newest, most attention-driven headline updated 100 times a day. As everyone probably knows, **the news makes us depressed if we read it every day**. They are rather focused on the negative or radical things instead of things that would make fun to read.\n\nI usually read once a while in my [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed, where I have subscribed to all blog posts, and specific categories of news I’m interested in and read through it. The significant benefit: I can quickly glance over 100 posts without distraction. On top of these tools, for example, I’m using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), they have some ratings and marks on how many others have read it. These ratings give me a sense of urgency if I only have a short time, and I want to know what’s happening. I can just read the high-rated once.\n\nReading negative headlines and depressing news will, over time, make you think wrong and depressed. With COVID, where most probably all of us read the news hourly, we know how this feels. Another aspect is that news typically reports from the whole world.

([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822917541400577))\n- Start with the end in mind\n  What do you want the outcome of your story to be?\n  • Customer buying a product\n  • Friend laughing his ass off\n  • Investor giving you money\n  If you start with the end in mind, the intro and middle naturally funnel to that target. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822919835631616))\n- Make it emotional\n  People make decisions based on emotion.\n  But it’s impossible to make your audience feel everything.\n  Nail down 1-2 emotions and direct the entire story to amplify those.\n  I regularly refer to this chart from @ShaanVP: \n  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYWhO_cXEAELoSP.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822929360986116))\n- Raise the stakes\n  Apple realized the iPhone was competing on the same few features each release.\n  So it raised the stakes: privacy.\n  This tells two stories:\n  • Apple protects your privacy\n  • Competitors exploit your privacy\n  The story became a feature with iOS 14.5. \n  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYWhPUGWAAA1gbb.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822935568748544))\n- Use data intentionally\n  Numbers tell, stories sell.\n  But if used well, data backs up the story you’re telling.\n  I aim to use 1-3 high-impact data points to support my stories. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822939007778827))\n- Keep a story log\n  You have story-worthy moments every day but forget almost all of them. Simple fix:\n  • Create a two column spreadsheet (date and story)\n  • Before bed, take two minutes to write the best story from that day\n  You’ll start seeing stories everywhere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822941163769856))\n- Structure your story\n  Humans gravitate to structure. Luckily there are tons to wrap around your story:\n  • Hero’s Journey\n  • StoryBrand\n  • Three Act\n  Here’s the structure JK Rowling used for the 5th Harry Potter: \n  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYWhP_IX0AETR6F.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822946544943106))\n- Talk to a niche\n  Great stories aren’t told to everyone.\n  They’re told to the specific group of people who will resonate most with them.\n  The idea of “1000 true fans.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822948969250816))\n- Nail the hook\n  It doesn’t matter how incredible the rest of your story is if nobody sticks around for it.\n  A few guidelines:\n  • Punchy\n  • Short\n  • “Big if true”\n  Here’s the hook Steve Jobs used for the iPhone product launch: https://t.co/0OiNWor5CB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822951095877632))\n- Sell the transformation\n  Great storytelling boils down to the transformation the Hero goes through.\n  Nike never sells its clothing — it sells what the clothing can do for you.\n  “If you wear our stuff, you’ll jump like LeBron, run like Ronaldo, and hit like Serena.” \n  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYWhQkJWIAMPutt.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822955776720899))\n- Hope you enjoyed that!\n  I write about storytelling 1-2x times per week.

So how to get better, and what about writing makes it so hard?\n\n## Approaches\nApproaches to how I write are in my [[Second Brain]]. I will write [[Fleeting Notes]], collecting [[Literature Notes]] with mostly Readwise synced directly into [[Obsidian]], writing them out as [[Permanent Notes]], and tagging them as `#publish` to move them to my public brain.\n\nI was having this all accessible in one place, connecting and [[Linking Your Thinking (LYT)]] notes and ideas with each other, sparking many new ideas and inspirations I didn't have before.\n\nI like the quote from [[Writing Handbook by Julian Shapiro]]:\n\u003e Writing is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch. \n\n## Process \n\u003e [!note] I always need to remind myself:\n\u003e Writing is hard! It's easy to start, hard to finish. You get stuck, you have a blockage, your creativity is low, you get interrupted, and you lose confidence in your writing. Reminding myself that the first 10 minutes are the hardest and envisioning the end product keeps me motivated.\n\nThis is what brought me to writing. To release my thoughts (brain dump), make my brain accessible for more, for being creative. I like to brainstorm, change, delete, add, research, and do the thinking while writing. When writing on a computer, I can do it almost at the speed of my thinking; I do not lose thoughts as I would when writing on paper ([[Journaling#Digital vs Paper]]). I can stop at any given time and come back, as all the thinking is written down. As well, I love the editing part. Making it better, finding correlations, and things I wouldn't have expected before. \n\nBut before getting into the editing phase, during the initial phase, when drafting or coming up with the content itself, I try to get into distraction-free [[Deep Work|Flow]]. Long chunks of uninterrupted time, [[Cal Newport]] talks about [[Deep Work]] in his book.\n\nUsually, editing is when I learn the most, but at the same time, it's also the most challenging step. I will get into a [[Writers Block]] and want to start a new thing instead. But by switching between [[Creativity vs Productivity]] or just going into nature with my thoughts and nothing else, usually one of them helps. Or if not, I leave it for a couple of days, weeks, months, and come back when another time. Keeping the [[Ultradian Rhythm]] in mind also helps overcome the initial hardest ten minutes. \n\nWhen I let the writing stay for a while, that typically leads to better quality because when I come back, I have new insight and might delete or change existing thoughts. The longer the wait, the more insightful that note will get. Therefore I like keeping it slow. In the end, the reader will not mind if you spend one day or three months on an article; he appreciates it if the [[reader flow]] is good and he can learn. At least that is my goal as a writer, to give some learnings to the readers.\n\nWriting doesn't always need to be about an article. You can just put some thought, [[Journaling]], or something you learned or find interesting, into a note. Save it for later. You mostly don't need the thing you just knew at that moment. Something you find interesting today is doubtful to be of value right now. But maybe in two years from now.\n\nOther things I'm pondering are [[Writing a good intro]], [[How to Write (Titles, Heading, Bolding, etc.)]], [[Long vs Short Form Posts]], [[How to Write Well]], [[Learn in Public]], or [[1000 True Fans]]. As well as having found my writing voice was important. In short, I need to write from experience and cannot create a free story—more in [[My Writing Process]] and [[My Writing Voice]].\n\nMore on [[How to Write Well]].\n\n## Goals\nOn the other hand, as I write more, I also want to learn more and get better at it. That's why one of my [[⚽️  My Three to Five Year Vision]] is just that. \n\nI started a long time ago with a blog back in 2005, and it was probably one of the best decisions for my writing portfolio or career. Besides loving to design and create websites for a long, it's also felt that I could keep my content over time. Imagine only lately with platforms such as Medium and Substack; they come and go. Simon Willson says the same in his Tweets ([[Tweets From Simon Willison]]):\n\u003e Start a blog! The best time to start one was twenty years ago. The second best time is today.\n\nRelated [[The Most Important Skill...]] for writing is storytelling, Nathan says.

This handbook helps you write nonfiction books and blogs for three reasons: 1 Gain leverage\n- Writing is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch.\n- Clarity of thought\n- When you write, your brain can't stop itself from drawing connections between ideas—and exploring their implications. This shines a light on broken logic, which helps you gain clarity of thought. Writing is the act of thinking clearly with the help of paper. Writing slows down your thinking so you can play with your ideas. 3 Human connection The most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet. If you do interesting things then write about them publicly with an authentic voice, like-minded people want to meet the person behind that voice.

This **approach will further dilute the idea of a librarian who organizes books in main categories and sub-folder and focuses only on the thought at hand as an individual note**. Instead of spending lots of your brainpower on which folder to put a specific note in, you start creating it in one folder for all and linking them together. Usually, you wouldn't have any structure in these concepts, but I combined the two methods into my Second Brain. You also see in the above design under `💡 Resources/🗃 Zettelkasten` I have its folder.\n\nThe Zettelkasten method is a **personal strategy process for thinking and writing. Similar to the [[Second Brain]], It helps the daily consumed overload of data**. It does not only help to store and organize knowledge but also improves your memory and knowledge retention. The Zettelkasten method is suitable for when you want to systematically organize vital information, find the information again, even years later, and develop your ideas.\n\nIn a Zettelkasten, we talk about three main types of notes. Firstly you start with **[[Fleeting Notes]], which are quick, informal notes on any thought or idea that pops into your mind.** They don't need to be highly organized, and in fact, shouldn't be. They are not meant to capture an idea in full detail but serve as reminders of what is in your head.\n\nThe second is [[Literature Notes]]. [[Niklas Luhmann]] would write them down on index cards with the bibliographic details on the back. Each contains the main point he didn't want to forget or thought he could use in his writing. \n\nSönke Ahrens offers four guidelines for creating literature notes:\n- Be **highly selective** in what you decide to keep\n- Keep the **overall note as short** as possible\n- **Use your own words** instead of copying quotes verbatim\n- **Write down the bibliographic details** on the source.\n\nThis third step starts with looking through the first two kinds of notes that you've created: [[Fleeting Notes]] and [[Literature Notes]].**[[Permanent Notes]]** are the last and most important ones. **They make up the long-term knowledge** that gives the Zettelkasten its value. As you go through them, think about how they relate to your research, current thinking, or interests. **The goal is not just to collect ideas but also to develop arguments and discussions over time.** If you need help jogging your memory, look at the existing topics in your Zettelkasten since it already contains only things that interest you. Ask yourself open questions to deepen your thinking and bring you outside your comfort zone thinking.\n\n\u003e [!danger] Delete fleeting notes after rewriting\n\u003e Once this step of rewriting in your own words is done: **Throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes** from step one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic Zettelkasten.\n\nThis approach needs time to get used to, and I'm still in its progress. But I can already feel considerable power, and I'm starting to put all my notes in my Zettelkasten folder, except for the `⚛️ Areas` folder where repeated things come in, such as family, health, work, etc. and `📬 Inbox` where any notes get put into as first before being moved to Zettelkasten or Areas. \n\nIt saves me a lot of time, while as a Swiss, I'm very organised and want to structure. The Zettelkasten helps me to focus on the content instead. It also gives me a relaxed state if I write something down quickly without too much thought, that I will organically find it later when needed or when I go through my open loops in my Inbox. Which most often sparks new ideas and starts my connected thinking yet again from another angle.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Tool of Choice\n\u003e I use Obsidian for [linking my thoughts](https://youtu.be/q0Pf6ZePNGc) in a full Zettelkasten manner. More on that read [How to take notes in 2022](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/how-to-take-notes-in-2021/).\n\n---\n\nMore:\n\nThe method is a personal strategy process for thinking and writing. It helps the daily consumed overload of data. Does not only help to store and organize knowledge but also improves your memory and knowledge retention. The Zettelkasten method is good for when you want to:\n-   Systematically organize important information\n-   Find information again, even years later\n-   Develop your own ideas\n\nZettelkasten method comprises three main types of notes:\n- [[Fleeting Notes]]\n- [[Literature Notes]]\n- [[Permanent Notes]]\n\n[[Niklas Luhmann]] started with the Zettelkasten or also called Slip-Box because he rejected the way of storing his thoughts and notes in an alphabetical categorization way. Therefore he started a research \"database\" made of index cards ([[Zettel]]) that were thematically unlimited and extended to infinity in any direction.\n\nThe system work as he writes down potentially useful ideas he encountered while reading on a small slip card. One idea per slip card. He links them if they are on the same topic or branch if it's new ideas. As he read books or whatever, he would create new notes, update or add comments to existing cards or create new branches/links along the way.
