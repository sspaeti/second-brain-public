A big part of everyone is email. Although I argue against email and instead proposeÂ [a way we (should) communicate](https://sspaeti.com/blog/email-and-the-way-we-should-communicate-at-work/), itâ€™s still a big part of work or other areas of life. Unfortunately, itâ€™s like an empty to-do list for everyone else to add tasks, making it dangerous. The GTD method from aboveÂ **integrates email into the workflow by going through your email in the weekly reviews and adding essential emails to your to-do list**. I do that by forwarding the email to Nirvana which adds them automatically to my inbox.

Email Client

I use an email client calledÂ [Hey](https://hey.com/), which integrates many aspects discussed here already by itself that it sorts out almost all meaningless emails out of myÂ [imbox](https://www.hey.com/features/the-imbox/).
