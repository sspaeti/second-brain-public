Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and [[Functional Programming]].

Python is the de facto standard for [[Data Engineering]] next to [[SQL]]. 

## What aspects of Python should I learn that are most important for Data Engineering?
I'd learn how to writeÂ [[Functional Data Engineering]]Â code within python. My favorite is dagster, which forces you to write functional blocks of code with superior features. [[Python and Functional Programming]]Â is also an excellent read in that direction.

Python is one of the most accessible programming l code within Python. My favorite isÂ [[Dagster]], which forces you to write functional blocks of code with superior featuresâ€”coming from a more SQL, T-SQL, and PL-SQL background. As a data engineer, I'd say you'd not expect to write perfect code; it's better to know theÂ [[Big-O]] annotationÂ to avoid long-running data pipelines, even if your code doesn't look the prettiest. Static types such asÂ [[mypy]] might be another good one to know, as it will detect errors pre-runtime, which is the biggest problem of Python.
