title: Minimalism
---

A lifestyle I admire. Not really crazy to have only 15 items or so, but that is before you buy something that you need to sell. Or that you have more money to buy quality things that you enjoy and use more instead of buying new things all the time.

The essence of minimalism is:
> How might your life be better with less?

See more on my recent article about minimalism: [[Personal Knowledge Management Workflow for a Deeper Life#How it started Minimalism]]
