## Highlights
- "Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity - stay home, don't go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down."
- "People are often obsessed with needing to write original ideas. Forget it. You're a journalist with a day job in the tech industry."
- "Publishing ideas, learnings, opinions, for years & years is a great way to give. And you'll figure out how to capture value later."
- "Think of your writing on the same timescale as your career. Write on a multi-decade timeframe. This means, don't just pub on Quora/Medium."
