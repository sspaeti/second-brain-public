title: Writers Block

As with [[Creativity vs Productivity]], I try to embrace the block and do some creative work instead. Writing is supposed to be hard. If you go on and get over the first 10 minutes ([[Ultradian Rhythm]]), you will get into the flow and [[Deep Work]] again.

What else can we learn from writer's block?  

Lots to learn also on [[Four Thousand Weeks, Time Management for Mortals - Oliver Burkeman]] and discussion in the podcast with [[Four Thousand Weeks, Time Management for Mortals - Oliver Burkeman#From the Podcast discussion with Ali Abdaal]].
