title: What has Rust in common with DuckDB?
---

I'm constantly thinking about what [[Rust]] and [[DuckDB]] have in common. I'm constantly interchanging them when thinking about one or the other, but why? ðŸ¤”

DuckDB is doing a zero-copy on top of Parquet, CSV, and Excel files. At the same time, Rust is doing a zero-cost abstraction (see [[Rust for Data Engineers]]) on top of C, Python, and Ruby. 

So they are very similar, which gives Rust a huge plus, as it's a full-blown programming language. Anything else?
