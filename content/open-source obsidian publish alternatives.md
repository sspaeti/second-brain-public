title: Open-Source Obsidian Publish Alternatives
---

As [[Obsidian]] Publish is great but expensive, I'm interested in an open-source solution that I can integrate into my blog.

Here are some examples:
**- [[Quartz - Publish Obsidian Vault]] (seem to be the best with [[GoHugo]] integration!)**
- [[Obsidian Digital Garden]]
- [[Mindstone]]
- [[Foam VSCode Extension|Foam VSCode Extension]]
- Free Obsidian Plugin that can share directly [obsius-obsidian-plugin: Easily publish notes to the web](https://github.com/jonstodle/obsius-obsidian-plugin)
- [[Graph Share]]
- [pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian)
- [[Vim]]
	- [[Brain- A Zettelkasten software for terminal users]]
	- Zettelkasten with vim: [GitHub - renerocksai/telekasten.nvim](https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim)I
	- [GitHub - michal-h21/vim-zettel: [[VimWiki]] addon for managing notes according to Zettelkasten method](https://github.com/michal-h21/vim-zettel)

Good combination with a Glossary entry page such as shown here by Secoda: [75+ Data Terms: Modern Data Definitions Glossary](https://www.secoda.co/glossary).

I implemented my [[Public Second Brain with Quartz]] on [brain.sspaeti.com](https://brain.sspaeti.com).
