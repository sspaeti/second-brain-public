itâ€™s aÂ **philosophy**Â designed to make usÂ **more resilient, happier, more virtuous and wiserâ€“and as a result, better people, better parents and better professionals.**Â Sounds a bit utopic? Maybe it is, but it helped me early in my personal life and career. I first heard of it by, again, Tim Ferriss and all his guests reading it. Famous leaders have been practising and shaping it, such asÂ [[Marcus Aurelius]], the emperor of Rome,Â [[Theodore Roosevelt]],Â [[Epictetus]],Â [[Seneca]], to name a few.

I got hooked when I read my all-time favourite bookÂ [[The Daily Stoic - Ryan Holidays]], which makes it easier for people new to it. Quotes such as focusing on whatâ€™s in your control are stayed strong until today:

> The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I controlâ€¦ â€” Epictetus

I practise this every day. For example, with [[COVID19]],Â [we canâ€™t control it](https://dailystoic.com/remember-you-dont-control-what-happens-you-control-how-you-respond/), no cursing, no ignoring will ever make it away. So the only way is to control ourselves and decide how we want to react to it. Itâ€™s another classic one, but many people face it twice a day andÂ **valuable waste energy in traffic when they get angry at other drivers**. Why? Does it make any of it go away? Not really.

Instead, I try to think for myself that these people we get angry at just having an emergency, maybe they are on the way to the hospital. If thinking it in that way, at least to me, Iâ€™m not even mad at them anymore. The same goes for the weather. How many people are in a bad mood if the weather is not as the weather forecast proclaimed, or if itâ€™s just bad? Next time, try not to think you can control the outcome; instead, maintain your reaction towards it by not getting angry or just staying calm.

This book is so powerful that I always have it on my phone, and at least once a week, I listen to two or three chapters. As the title saysÂ [366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736), is applied meditation to me. By doing so, Iâ€™m always more calm and more understanding of my outside world and things I canâ€™t control.
