title: Routines such as Sports or Meditation
---

Many studies say that we should start a routine or it doesn't stick. I'm not too good at this, but I try to do it primarily for my weekly sports, meditation, or writing habits. But as with kids, it is not as easy as before. I do my best whenever possible and do not try to feel bad if I can't find the time. As it's important to me, as any parent knows, **there is no more important task in life than being a parent and spending undistracted time with your kids**. 

On the other hand, I go more often for a walk with no audio and no distraction: just by myself and my mind. For me, it's another way of meditation and doing sports simultaneously. Also, walking inside a forest or nature grounds me typically to what matters and releases stress automatically.
