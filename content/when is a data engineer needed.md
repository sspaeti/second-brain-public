title: When is a data engineer needed?
---

I believe, that **not every company is in need of data engineers**. His skills are mostly required if the company either:

  * has already a product that is fully web-based and therefore data-driven 
  * the need or desire to analyze lots of data (Volume) from any kind of sources (Variety) and fast (Velocity) to get the insights (Value and Veracity) (see more about the <a href="https://miuc.org/vs-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five V's of Big Data</a>)
