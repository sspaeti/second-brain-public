title: Digital Minimalism
---

The elephant in the room is todayâ€™s distractions, such asÂ **social media apps that the most advanced technology companies make and Neuroscientists to make youÂ [addicted](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day)**. InÂ [[Digital Minimalism - Cal Newport]],Â [[Cal Newport]]Â suggests that deleting all social media apps is already a good start as all companies will track you through the app. Instead, use the browser, they will have less or no GPS information when you open the app, cannot send you to push notifications, etc. You are already addicted, as hard as you want to tell yourself otherwise.

Another way to get out of the loop is aÂ [30 day sabbatical from social media](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/21/quit-social-media/). To get back to you and see what you truly miss. Instead of scrolling through Instagram whenever you wait 2 seconds, maybe you can do it once a week Friday evening with a glass of wine. Wouldnâ€™t that sound amazing?

Besides the book, follow Cal Newport on hisÂ [website](https://www.calnewport.com/)Â or read more onÂ [[Slow Productivity]].
