Or also called *flow*. Introduced in the book [[Deep Work - by Cal Newport]].

## How I get into Deep Work (*Flow*)

1. Journal before going to bed what 1-2 tasks you must/want to achieve tomorrow. 
2. Go to bed early (at night, you usually don't achieve much anyhow)
3. Have a good sleep
4. Get up before the kids :) (don't turn on the phone). 
5. Make your bed. 
6. Later take a walk in nature after lunch. 
7. Change environment/room if stuck.

Others:
- Clear some time in your calendar.
- Get rid of any distractions: Turn off notifications, close Slack, and put your phone out of reach.Â   
- Clear your space and your mind. Put on concentration music, and get rid of any clutter around.Â   
- Get to work on a specific task, taking periodic short breaks.
