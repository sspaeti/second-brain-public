Using your time intentionally. It's efficient and minimizes waste.

For me has a lot to do with [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]], but also goes deep into our life, that's why my article about [[Personal Knowledge Management Workflow for a Deeper Life]] summarises it probably best up until this point.

Relates to [[Deep Work]], [[Deep Life]], [[Slow Productivity]].
