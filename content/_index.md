This is my public [[Second Brain]] organized as a [[Zettelkasten]] (sometimes also called [[Digital Garden]]).

## Navigation
You can go inside my Brain by clicking through the [[Zettel]]s on the [[Map of Content (MOC)]] below and go deeper inside the brain. You can also use the search on the top right or simply `cmd+k` (`ctrl+k` on Windows).

## Map of Content (MOC)
Here I will give you some starting points of what my Second Brain contains:
- [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]]
- [[Deep Life]]
- [[Writing]]
- [[Data Engineering]]
	- [[Data Orchestrators]]
- [[Kubernetes]]
- many more to come
