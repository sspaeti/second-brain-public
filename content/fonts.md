I have a love for nice fonts.

## Reading and Writing Fonts
- [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) (mentioned [Your favourite fonts choice and why? thread - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/your-favourite-fonts-choice-and-why-thread/18129/5?u=sspaeti) )
- [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/8548eea983611993db2d6f65bd3ae1609f62dcbd) 
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Default of [[Obsidian]] and used also at [[Airbyte]] website
- [[Fonts - DYSLEXIA]] which makes reading easier for people with problems (from [[Tobias Schäuble]])
- Piazzolla, serif; from [How to treat monospace alike fonts in a tech blog? - Pimp my Type](https://pimpmytype.com/review-tech-blog/)
	- [Piazzolla Type System](https://piazzolla.huertatipografica.com/)

## Programming Fonts
Here are some tips for programming (from [[15 Best Programming Fonts for Better Coding]]):
- Clear and easy-to-read characters to reduce eye strain when spending hours looking at hundreds of lines of code.
- Makes a clear distinction between commonly-confused characters such as the letter “O” and the number “0” or the lowercase “L” and the number “1”.
- Ligatures or extra whitespace for commonly-used symbols in popular programming languages – not for everyone, but others love it.
- Fonts with multiple variations on how certain characters are handled are great, so you can pick and choose exactly the version you prefer.

Testing out fonts: [Programming Fonts - Test Drive](https://www.programmingfonts.org/).
