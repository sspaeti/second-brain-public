## Configuration
Quartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.

The majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.

```yaml {title="data/config.yaml"}
# The name to display in the footer
name: Jacky Zhao

# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page
# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the
# front-matter of that note
enableToc: true

# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page
openToc: false

# whether to display on-hover link preview cards
enableLinkPreview: true

# whether to render titles for code blocks
enableCodeBlockTitle: true 

# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks
enableCodeBlockCopy: true 

# whether to render callouts
enableCallouts: true

# whether to try to process Latex
enableLatex: true

# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering
# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves
# smoothness of Quartz. More info in issue #109 on GitHub
enableSPA: true

# whether to render a footer
enableFooter: true

# whether backlinks of pages should show the context in which
# they were mentioned
enableContextualBacklinks: true

# whether to show a section of recent notes on the home page
enableRecentNotes: false

# whether to display an 'edit' button next to the last edited field
# that links to github
enableGitHubEdit: true
GitHubLink: https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo/content

# whether to use Operand to power semantic search
# IMPORTANT: replace this API key with your own if you plan on using
# Operand search!
enableSemanticSearch: false
operandApiKey: "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OPERAND-API-KEY"

# page description used for SEO
description:
  Host your second brain and digital garden for free. Quartz features extremely fast full-text search,
  Wikilink support, backlinks, local graph, tags, and link previews.

# title of the home page (also for SEO)
page_title:
  "ðŸª´ Quartz 3.3"

# links to show in the footer
links:
  - link_name: Twitter
    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao
  - link_name: Github
    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0
```

### Code Block Titles
To add code block titles with Quartz:

1. Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:

    ```yaml {title="data/config.yaml", linenos=false}
    enableCodeBlockTitle: true
    ```

2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block
   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):

      ```markdown {linenos=false}
       ```yaml {title="data/config.yaml"}
       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1
       ```
      ```

**Note** that if `{title=<my-title>}` is included, and code block titles are not
enabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.

### HTML Favicons
If you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you 
can add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set 
`favicon` key is:

```html {title="layouts/partials/head.html", linenostart=15}
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="icon.png" type="image/png">
```

The default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your 
`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is
equivalent to the default:

```yaml {title="data/config.yaml", linenos=false}
favicon:
  - { rel: "shortcut icon", href: "icon.png", type: "image/png" }
#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add
```

In this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.

If you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it
may be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the 
**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:

```yaml {title="data/config.yaml", linenos=false}
favicon: |
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="icon.png" type="image/png">
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
```

This second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your 
webpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more 
information about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read 
[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).

**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` 
attribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.

### Graph View
To customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.

```yaml {title="data/graphConfig.yaml"}
# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.
# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.
# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual
enableGlobalGraph: false

### Local Graph ###
localGraph:
    # whether automatically generate a legend
    enableLegend: false
    
    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph
    enableDrag: true
    
    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph
    enableZoom: true
    
    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)
    depth: 1
    
    # initial zoom factor of the graph
    scale: 1.2
    
    # how strongly nodes should repel each other
    repelForce: 2

    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity
    centerForce: 1

    # what the default link length should be
    linkDistance: 1
    
    # how big the node labels should be
    fontSize: 0.6
    
    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes
    opacityScale: 3

### Global Graph ###
globalGraph:
	# same settings as above

### For all graphs ###
# colour specific nodes path off of their path
paths:
  - /moc: "#4388cc"
```


## Styling
Want to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. 

### Partials
Partials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.

For example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`

More info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)

## Language Support
[CJK + Latex Support (æµ‹è¯•)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(æµ‹è¯•).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.

Want to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.

Follow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`

For example:

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = 'ar'
[languages]
  [languages.ar]
    languagedirection = 'rtl'
    title = 'Ù…Ø¯ÙˆÙ†ØªÙŠ'
    weight = 1
```
