If you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!

Note that both of these steps need to be completed.

## Install `hugo-obsidian`
This step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (>= 1.16) installed.

```bash
# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally
go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest
```

If you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.

Afterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!

##  Installing Hugo
Hugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with "extended" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,

```bash
# Navigate to your local Quartz folder
cd <location-of-your-local-quartz>

# Start local server
make serve

# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/
```
