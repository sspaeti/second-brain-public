title: How to Write Well?
---

It's hard, it's painful as Stephen mentions in [[On Writing - Stephen King]] (especially [[On Writing - Stephen King#GOOD WRITING]]) and [[The Elements of Style - William Strunk Jr]].

Writing when you have some notes and starting is the hard part. Starting out there is lots of entiasumus, but after a while when this goes away, it's tough.

It's easiest to postpone or do other things. 

What I try to do is to turn off the Wifi and turn off the phone and force myself for two hours on writing straight (go to a library/outside when you can). It's so painful, and it doesn't matter the quality of the writing. It will be bad. But just that in a second phase you can go through and cut out the bad and leave the good.

As many say, just write on, some days you write poor some days better. Don't worry you will filter them out later.

> When I spend a lot of time optimizing an article, and I can see the changes and how the article improves with each edit, that makes me happy every time and is just a magical moment as you never know how it will end up before you do the hard work.

It's also very much connected to [[Atomic Habits - James Clear]] and [[Optimize My Sleep]] where you have a good mind and maybe you get up early to write first thing in the morning without distraction!
