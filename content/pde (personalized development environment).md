It's a term that [[TJDeVries]] brought up with [[Neovim]] instead of only measuring speed. And also because [[IDE]] is not the right word as [[vim]] is not really an IDE. [[Neovim]] is a text editor but can do much more, even more than [[VSCode]] in certain use cases with [[LSP]] and [[Treesitter]].
