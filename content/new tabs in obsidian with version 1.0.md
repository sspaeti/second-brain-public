title: New Tabs in Obsidian with version 1.0
---

[Obsidian 1.0](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-0-0/44873) was released this week ([[2022-10-15]]). 

The `Sliding Panes (Andy Matuschak Mode)` plugin is now a core of Obsidian and is called `Stacked Tabs`.

Besides panes, we also got `tabs`. Tabs are like a tab in [[vim]] that can hold several panes (buffers in vim). This allows me to stack a tab (maybe the one I'm writing in) and the tab with many panes for reference. Tabs can also be stacked below and above, making them more flexible.

The design is much slicker, and it is faster. It all together looks and feels good and stable.

Here is an example of how it looks with my own Kanagawa Design:

The zoom level has been arranged, and the unlinked and linked backlinks are now in line with the zoom (it was something that was off before).
