The second is [[Literature Notes]]. [[Niklas Luhmann]] would write them down on index cards with the bibliographic details on the back. Each of them contains the main point he didn’t want to forget or that he thought he could use in his own writing. The bibliographic details are the `🌍 Wiki 📂 Files` where my [[Reference Wiki Notes]] are stored.

Ahrens offers four guidelines for creating literature notes:
- Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
- Keep the overall note as short as possible
- Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
- Write down the bibliographic details on the source.

Next follows polished and written in my own words to [[Permanent Notes]].
