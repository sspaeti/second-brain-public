title: Markdown Admonition
---

TheÂ `admonition`,Â also known asÂ _call-outs_, are shortcuts baked into most Markdown framework. It's a nice way to include side content without significantly interrupting the reading flow.

> [!example] Example Admonition
>
> This is an Admonition that is built into my website framework [[GoHugo]]. It supports 12 differentÂ types of admonitions.


[[Markdown]] or HTML format in the content is supported.
- AÂ **note**Â banner
- AnÂ **abstract**Â banner
- AnÂ **info**Â banner
- and so forth, 

A good list of different admonitions on [Extended Shortcodes](https://ublogger.netlify.app/theme-documentation-extended-shortcodes/), which is the theme for my website.
