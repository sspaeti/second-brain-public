## Highlights
- The most important skill you’ve never been taught:
  Storytelling
  10 dead-simple tips to make you a better storyteller: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822914823491584))
- Cut the fluff
  Most people amble on in backstory for 10 minutes or write an intro paragraph.
  This is a waste of time.
  Find the interesting parts of your story, jump right to it, and provide as little backstory as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822917541400577))
- Start with the end in mind
  What do you want the outcome of your story to be?
  • Customer buying a product
  • Friend laughing his ass off
  • Investor giving you money
  If you start with the end in mind, the intro and middle naturally funnel to that target. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822919835631616))
- Make it emotional
  People make decisions based on emotion.
  But it’s impossible to make your audience feel everything.
  Nail down 1-2 emotions and direct the entire story to amplify those.
  I regularly refer to this chart from @ShaanVP:

- Raise the stakes
  Apple realized the iPhone was competing on the same few features each release.
  So it raised the stakes: privacy.
  This tells two stories:
  • Apple protects your privacy
  • Competitors exploit your privacy
  The story became a feature with iOS 14.5.

- Use data intentionally
  Numbers tell, stories sell.
  But if used well, data backs up the story you’re telling.
  I aim to use 1-3 high-impact data points to support my stories. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822939007778827))
- Keep a story log
  You have story-worthy moments every day but forget almost all of them. Simple fix:
  • Create a two column spreadsheet (date and story)
  • Before bed, take two minutes to write the best story from that day
  You’ll start seeing stories everywhere. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822941163769856))
- Structure your story
  Humans gravitate to structure. Luckily there are tons to wrap around your story:
  • Hero’s Journey
  • StoryBrand
  • Three Act
  Here’s the structure JK Rowling used for the 5th Harry Potter:

- Talk to a niche
  Great stories aren’t told to everyone.
  They’re told to the specific group of people who will resonate most with them.
  The idea of “1000 true fans.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822948969250816))
- Nail the hook
  It doesn’t matter how incredible the rest of your story is if nobody sticks around for it.
  A few guidelines:
  • Punchy
  • Short
  • “Big if true”
  Here’s the hook Steve Jobs used for the iPhone product launch: https://t.co/0OiNWor5CB ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1550822951095877632))
- Sell the transformation
  Great storytelling boils down to the transformation the Hero goes through.
  Nike never sells its clothing — it sells what the clothing can do for you.
  “If you wear our stuff, you’ll jump like LeBron, run like Ronaldo, and hit like Serena.”

- The story log concept seems to be resonating
  here's mine (started it july 1)
  the key for me has been keeping it short and informal. it provides just enough context to jog my memory
  idea came from the book storyworthy: https://t.co/Fg6xTB95Pt
