Synonym for [[Permanent Notes]] or [[Evergreen Notes]] (from [[Taxonomy of note types]]):
>  Evergreen / Permanent Notes. These are my long-running notes that will end up to my Zettelkasten core with my own words. Here I basically separated the literature notes into separate notes and ideas to follow the zettelkasten principle and link them together

Awesome write-up in [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

Another good one content-wise is [Personal Wiki / Digital Garden](https://strikingloo.github.io/wiki/) with lots of information about [[Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]] but made with a Wiki instead of Linking [[Linking Your Thinking (LYT)]] by [[Nick Milo]]. Another one is [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/).
