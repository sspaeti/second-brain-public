title: Creativity vs Productivity
---

Creativity and [[Productivity]] are two of the same thing. You can't be creative without being productive at taking notes. It's kind of a pendulum that goes forth and back (see Origin below for more).

For me, these are two different things that I do interchangeably. I chose to be creative, where I try to be productive all the time but do not force it, especially for writing and coding; I experienced its contra effective to be super productive at everything. That's why as [[Tiago Forte]] says, it needs to go forth and back to have the right balance. Fixating on one does not bring you forward. 

I also experienced it with [[vim]] where I tried to upgrade my productivity until all I do is optimize constantly. But also after a while, I did the same with [[Obsidian]], if I found a good ground, I do not change too much anymore, and I am so much more productive (and also having fun at the same time) than when I wouldn't have invested these initial time that wasn't productive. It reminds me of [[PDE (Personalized Development Environment)]], where fun is also a part of the equation.
