If English is the language of business, SQL is the language ofÂ data and Python is the language of engineering. While technology disappears often, SQL is still here. This means you need a reliable understanding of:

  * **[[SQL]] to a high level of complexity**
      * e.g. using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_window_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">window</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate</a> functions, changing the structure of a database with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDL</a> or changing the data with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DML</a>, fine-tuning or reading database <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">execution plans</a>, how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indices</a>
  * **Data modeling techniques:** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERD</a>s and dimensional modeling
  * Solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETL</a> **understanding**
  * Architectural projections:Â needs to have a **high-level understanding of most of the tools, platforms, libraries, and other resources** at its disposal
  * able to connect the dots from source to destination with any **programming language** that does the job best. (Probably Python at the moment)

[Stitchdata.com](https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/reports/the-state-of-data-engineering/) anticipated that as company size increased, so would the focus on scaling-related skills. However, that's not the story the data told. Instead, data engineers at **larger companies tend to be more focused on enterprise skills like ETL, BI, and data warehousing, whereas data engineers at smaller companies focus more on core technologies**:
