title: Fleeting Notes
---

Fleeting notes are quick, informal notes on any thought or idea that pops your mind. They donâ€™t need to be highly organized and shouldnâ€™t be. They are not meant to capture a picture in full detail but serve as reminders of what is in your head.

Fleeting Notes live primarily in my ðŸ“¬ inbox and could be random thoughts, hilights from [[ReadWise]], copy-pastes of books, anything.

Fleeting Notes are connected with [[Literature Notes]] and will result in self-written and polished [[Permanent Notes]].
