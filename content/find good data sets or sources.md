title: Find good Data Sets or Sources
---

Data sets are always useful for data engineering projects. Here are some listed that can help find one.

Some that offer great datasets:
- [Find Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) 
- If you need a big one, the New York Taxi is a famous one. They recently added the much better apache parquet format (but CSV is still there as well): 
	- https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
- less relevant for you, but here in Switzerland we have some open-data endeavors that try to open-source all data, e.g. 
	- CH: [[Open Data Swiss]]
	- US: https://data.gov/  
- The Seattle Data Guy also has great resources, e.g. here he suggests 5 of them: [5 Data Sources for Your Data Engineering Projects - Data Engineering Portfolio Part (1/5) - YouTube](https://youtu.be/LJkVvNWlO0g).
- Weekly newsletter of useful/curious datasets: [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)
