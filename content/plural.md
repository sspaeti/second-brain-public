Plural.sh is a unified application [[deployment]] platform that makes it easy to run [[open-source]] software on [[Kubernetes]]. Instead of using [[Terraform]] to deploy to Kubernetes, which starts to make it complicated (with all Kubernetes) involved.

Similar to other [[Stackable Kubernetes Cluster (Lego Blocks)]].
